Running backs coach Kolby Smith, who said earlier this summer that redshirt junior Trey Smith was the top back, said Smith has maintained his advantage.\n\n\"Trey is the guy,\" Kolby Smith said. \"He did a great job of earning it, and I don't see him letting it go.\"\n\nKolby Smith, 33 years old with nonstop energy, bounced into the lobby of the team's practice building after practice Saturday.\n\n\"What up!\" he exclaimed. Asked if he could still play, the former Louisville running back answered, \"I wish!\"\n\nHe seemed excited about where his group of backs stands after a brutal spring that saw every scholarship running back battling an injury by the time the spring game came around.\n\nBut Kolby Smith, seeking a silver lining, said the injuries meant more opportunities for the remaining backs.\n\nYou may like: Observations from the first day of Louisville football practice\n\nSee also: How could Louisville football use its freshmen this season?\n\nTrey Smith, the oldest running back on the roster, drew praise from his coaches during the spring and again Saturday.\n\n\"He does a good job running, this spring did a good job of really being patient on his runs and getting up in those little small cracks,\" Kolby Smith said. \"Thought he showed great vision. Definitely brings toughness. He's probably one of the best pass blockers on the team. Does a good job of being violent with his hands.\"\n\nAfter a summer of healing, Louisville opened preseason practice Friday with Trey Smith, redshirt sophomore Dae Williams, redshirt freshman Colin Wilson and junior Malik Staples, plus true freshmen Javian Hawkins and Hassan Hall, all healthy.\n\nAsked if he thinks it's finally his time after earning just 32 carries in his first three seasons, Trey Smith said, \"I really do hope so. I've been working my butt off just trying to get on the field. I've been trying to prove to the coaches that I'm working, trying to prove to my teammates that I've been working.\"\n\nSmith's father, Jimmy, played in the NFL from 1992-2005 and made five Pro Bowls with the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nTrey said through some difficult times in his first three years, his father told him even he faced struggles finding playing time at first.\n\n\"Just going back and watching the film and just running it back in my mind, that really helped a lot, and advice from my dad,\" Trey Smith said. \"Just keeping my spirits up, because there's a lot of times when I feel down — will I ever play here? — so the whole team has really been keeping me up.\"\n\nJake Lourim: 502-582-4168; jlourim@courierjournal.com; Twitter: @jakelourim.

SGF uses black and white. When\ntranscribing games with other colours (perhaps blue and red), Black\nshould be the player who played first.\n\nPoint\n\nPoints are designated with numbers, ranging from 11 (south-west\ncorner) to 99 (north-east). The first digit refers to the horizontal\ncoordinate. The second digit refers to the vertical.\n\nStone\n\nA \"stone\" is a pod and its prongs. The pod is identified by the\npoint where it is located. Prongs are designated with letters. \"A\"\nfaces north, \"B\" faces northeast, and so on through \"H\".\nFor example, 46CD.\n\nProng information may be omitted as long as the all pods in that\nstack have identical designations. This is always true for stacks of\nexactly one pod.\n\nMove\n\nTo bring a new pod onto the board, simply list its new location.\nFor example, 73. It is assumed that a captured pod is\nliberated if legal, otherwise a reserve pod is used.\n\nTo add a prong to a pod, list the stone, a plus sign (+), and\nthe letter of the new prong. For example, 33+B places a\nnortheast prong on the pod at point 33. (Superprongs are denoted with a\n\"!\", e.g., 33+B!.)\n\nTo reposition a prong so that it faces north, write 33+A-B.\n\nMoves are indicated by listing the stone, a dash, and the destination\npoint. Multiple jumps are done in a similar way; inserting a dash and a\npoint for each intermediate step. For example, in the diagram at right,\nthe piece at 84 moves as follows: 84-86-68.\n\nTo indicate a capture, specify an \"x\" in the destination point\nimmediately after the capture. In the example at right, the Blue\npod could capture the piece at 77. Record this move\n84-86-68x. If Blue instead wishes to capture its own pod,\nrecord 84-86x-68.\n\nOn rare occasions, only a select set of pods is to be captured\nfrom a jumped stack. List each captured pod with an \"x\", and\nits prong designation. Augmenting the previous example a little,\n84-86-68xDxAB.\n\nTo move one or more pieces in a stack, list the moves for each pod\nseparated by a comma. To designate each pod, list its location and\nprong positions. For example, the move illustrated below would be\nrecorded 46CD-56,46D-55.\n\nProperty: RU (rules)\nPropvalue: simpletext\nPropertytype: game-info\nFunction: Valid values are one major variation (\"full\", \"fast\",\nor \"kids\") followed by a colon and a comma separated\nelist of variations (\"edgeless\", \"superprong\", etc.).\nThe colon may be omitted if either side is empty.\nThe default is 2-player full, no variations.\nThe 4-player game is not currently available.\n\nOcti has special points, called \"octi squares\".

{"tokne_ids[:950]": " storyline tends to douse the flame.\n\nIt’s a sad comment on the state of network primetime that the fall TV season’s most exciting new couple happens to star in one of its dippiest shows. “To Have & to Hold” provides sparks galore from the captivating Moira Kelly and beefcakey Jason Beghe playing a Boston public defender and police detective, respectively, who happen to be passionately in love. Their chemistry burns white-hot. Yet for all of their sassy electricity, the storyline tends to douse the flame.\n\nBlame it on scribe Joanne T. Waters’ trite sense of male-female sparring, replete with feminist cliches and sexist repartee — all of it punctuated by a hackneyed Irish attitude because, hey, this is Boston. And even our lovebirds have problems in struggling to remain consistent. Seems they’ve already put off their nuptials twice before.\n\nMore Reviews\n\nOpening entry paints vivid pictures of two adults so different they simply can’t be apart. The sexual energy that drives together Sean McGrail (Beghe) and Annie Cornell (Kelly, with breakout potential in every simmer) is undeniable. So is their equally fiery banter. Sean — he of the washboard abs and low-key intensity — accuses Annie of being a feminist. Annie — with her pouty lips and headstrong demeanor — calls Sean a chauvinist pig. If this were the schoolyard at recess, they’d both be looking at an hour of detention.\n\nFirst hour’s pointless plotlines include an A-story in which a buffoonish couple (Raymond O’Connor, Debra Jo Rupp) draw the attention of their police neighbors after the husband fires five shots to scare his wife. It works. She presses charges. He gets locked up. She changes her tune and wants him sprung. We know that she’s serious about this because she’s just baked a macaroni and cheese casserole for Annie in the hope that the cuisine will help inspire the defense lawyer to end this mess.\n\nBut Annie is far too obsessed with what Sean did at his bachelor party to much care about noodles. It all spills out during a preposterous courtroom scene in which she grills her husband-to-be on the stand about strippers and thong underwear. Just who does the lady think she’s talking to, the president of the United States?\n\nUltimately, this is a show that doesn’t know if it wants to be a comedy or a drama, and winds up dropping the ball on both counts.\n\nAiring opposite “The Drew Carey Show,” “3rd Rock From the Sun,” “NewsRadio” and “Party of Five,” “To Have & To Hold” will likely be put out of its misery soon enough. Tech credits, however, are first rate.\n\nSign Up for Daily Insider Newsletter\n\nIt’s a sad comment on the state of network primetime that the fall TV season’s most exciting new couple happens to star in one of its dippiest shows. “To Have & to Hold” provides sparks galore from the captivating Moira Kelly and beefcakey Jason Beghe playing a Boston public defender and police detective, respectively, who […]\n\nIt’s a sad comment on the state of network primetime that the fall TV season’s most exciting new couple happens to star in one of its dippiest shows. “To Have & to Hold” provides sparks galore from the captivating Moira Kelly and beefcakey Jason Beghe playing a Boston public defender and police detective, respectively, who […]\n\nIt’s a sad comment on the state of network primetime that the fall TV season’s most exciting new couple happens to star in one of its dippiest shows. “To Have & to Hold” provides sparks galore from the captivating Moira Kelly and beefcakey Jason Beghe playing a Boston public defender and police detective, respectively, who […]\n\nIt’s a sad comment on the state of network primetime that the fall TV season’s most exciting new couple happens to star in one of its dippiest shows. “To Have & to Hold” provides sparks galore from the captivating Moira Kelly and beefcakey Jason Beghe playing a Boston public defender and police detective, respectively, who […]\n\nIt’s a sad comment on the", "token_ids[950:1000]": " state of network primetime that the fall TV season’s most exciting new couple happens to star in one of its dippiest shows. “To Have & to Hold” provides sparks galore from the captivating Moira Kelly and beef", "count": 1, "near-dup-count": 1, "extractable/{sequence_length}": true, "last_iteration": 60000}

{"tokne_ids[:950]": ", it yields no results. It looks like Vine app is filtering out x-rated material. Nothing to freak out about.\n\nSure, you can access porn in Safari, but you also have the option of blocking Safari access through parental controls. The rating is appropriate given the content that is easily accessed through Vine, and simply gives parents the option to prevent their children from accessing the app, if desired.\n\nIn the App Store, yes, all browsers are automatically rated +17. Including Google's Chrome.\n\nThese apps may not contain inappropriate material, however they can readily be used to access such. An important distinction for parents.\n\nI came here to say pretty much this. The issue is pretty much overblown, imho. Most photo gallery apps and many reference sources I could find are labeled at least 12+ with one of the reasons cited to be 'infrequent nudity' where anything that may conceivably be used to access 'frequent nudity' gets the 17+ rating.\n\nThese ratings are used for parental restrictions. For media the already has a rating system in place (movies and TV shows have several levels, whereas music only has the 'explicit' label) Apple uses that system but for apps, they've provided their own ratings system: 4+, 9+, 12+, and 17+. These ratings pretty much mean nothing unless the parental restrictions are utilized. Many Apple apps and some general features have individual control while 3rd party apps are toggled by the aforementioned rating tiers.\n\nI'm sure that if Vine wanted to put restrictions on content and police it themselves they could probably get a 12+ rating but the main issue is that, by design (#hashtags) the pornographic material was easily discoverable and also highly publicized. I'm sure that if it became a trend to draw photo-realistic titties on rooftops and parking lots, then most maps apps supporting satellite imagery would get at least a 12+, if not a 17+, dependent on frequency.\n\nWhat I do find kind of weird though, is that Snapchat is only 12+. I've never used that app but it was my impression that it is/was used largely for people to send this type of material to each other.\n\nInappropriate ratings may be changed by Apple”. If the app didn’t up its rating, that duty would be performed by Apple’s invisible hand.\n\nOkay, I guess it's my turn to be the Ars Pedant, but 'invisible hand' is usually used to refer, basically, to cause-and-effect in markets... countries that, say, issue too much debt for non-productive reasons will see their standards of living decline. It refers to sort of an impersonal web of effects that force corrective action when things get out of balance.\n\nIn this case, the hand is pretty darn visible. You might not see it, but it is a genuine, corporeal hand, belonging to some Apple employee typing and clicking somewhere. There's nothing impersonal about it, it's a direct decision by a single entity.\n\nIt's unclear to me from all the articles I've seen on Vine and 500px... are people (especially in the US) conflating nudity with \"porn\"?\n\nTo US users, I believe they are indeed one and the same as far as censorship goes, which explains why they will authorize all sorts of hate talk in the name of free speech but will censor countless works of arts in an instant if they happen to contain the hint of a nipple (never mind actual genitals).\n\nIt's unclear to me from all the articles I've seen on Vine and 500px... are people (especially in the US) conflating nudity with \"porn\"?\n\nTo US users, I believe they are indeed one and the same as far as censorship goes, which explains why they will authorize all sorts of hate talk in the name of free speech but will censor countless works of arts in an instant if they happen to contain the hint of a nipple (never mind actual genitals).\n\nTo be fair I don't imagine there's a great deal of fine art being posted under #porn\n\nIt's unclear to me from all the articles I've seen on Vine and 500px... are people (especially in the US) conflating nudity with \"porn\"?\n\nTo US users, I believe they are indeed one and the same as far as censorship goes, which explains why they will authorize all sorts of hate talk in the name of free speech but will", "token_ids[950:1000]": " censor countless works of arts in an instant if they happen to contain the hint of a nipple (never mind actual genitals).\n\nTo be fair I don't imagine there's a great deal of fine art being posted under #porn", "count": 1, "near-dup-count": 1, "extractable/{sequence_length}": true, "last_iteration": 80000}

If so this isn't necessary on the Olympus as it will automatically switch to the EVF as soon as you put your eye up to it (assuming you have this function enabled, which it is by default).\n\nTo get the real time view in the viewfinder similar to what you're used to on DSLR, you must have rec view (in the spanner menu) set to off, and shoot in continuous low NOT continuous high. Continuous hi does NOT show you a real time view. The only issue with continuous low on the EM1 mark I is the maximum frame rate is 6.5fps, which is slightly down on your 7D which I believe does 8fps. Technically you will see slightly longer blackout time between frames as you're only getting 6.5 frames as opposed to 8 frames, but how noticeable that will be I'm not sure. Shouldn't be massive.\n\nYou can also improve things a bit more by setting the screen refresh rate to High/120hz (it's 60hz by default) but you lose a bit of resolution at 120hz I believe, and battery life.

Cool graphic style, nice gameplay (a lil' bit different from original ones) great music and sound effects. The plot is not as awesome as on DMC 1 and 3 but still large way better than 2.\n\nI think Ninja Theory did a good job in fact, but not brilliant, that's why I give it 7 points.\n\nLet's hope they get better with age and DMC 2 do honor to the saga it belongs.…Expand\n\nI really enjoy this game. Apart from the nice feel to the combat, nice animations and a rather intuitive approach to combos (though maybe a bit too easy), I really like the background story. Sure, the main characters are horrible, but which are not? And maybe everything was better in the past games, as the negative reviews suggest, but that does not keep me from enjoying this one.

As a long time fan of DMC with 3 being my fav, i really enjoyed the game the story, the music and the hack and slash combat.

Most of the review i read of people giving it a 0, are just guy who love old Dante too much, yes his the iconic character that made the DMC what it is. But if you keep playing it some of Dante's old look comes to play aswell as his red coat when DT is used. His hair will probably come back in the next one so don't flag the game as a bad one because i bet most of you haven't even played it yet. A FACT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GIVING IT A 0 ARE TROLLS WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT NEW DANTE.…Expand\n\nIt is a good game. And it's a great restart for a whole franchise. New music, new characters, new moves, new original levels. DMC 4 was rather dull. There was nothing new in it, nothing original. This is a different story. Just give it a chance.\n\nfirst off, let me just say all the people hating on the game are idiots. DmC is a great game in it's own rights, and also a fantastic pc port! Gameplay is super smooth and graphics are fantastic. I think what many people have forgotten is that a game is meant to be FUN.
