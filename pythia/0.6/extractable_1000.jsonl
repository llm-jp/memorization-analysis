The spices of P. vulgaris in different storage period (including current year, first-year and second-year) were collected from Lujiang base in Anhui Province. The samples were randomized, with the methods of morphologic characteristics and commercial size on P. vulgaris, the samples were graded into three grades; according to the methods from the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China, water-soluble extracts, ethanol-soluble extracts, total ash and acid insoluble ash were measured, respectively, utilizing the UV spectrophotometry to detection the contents of total flavonoids and polysaccharides, the levels of ursolic acid, oleanolic acid and rosmarinic acid were adopted by HPLC. The total ash and acid insoluble ash of P. vulgaris showed significantly increase during prolonged storage; however, the content of water-soluble extracts, ethanol-soluble, total flavonoids, polysaccharides, ursolic acid, oleanolic acid,rosmarinic acid showed significantly decrease during prolonged storage. The spica of P. vulgaris exhibited no rules differences between the quality and grading standards, The second-degree belongs to high content of total flavonoids; the high content of polysaccharides was first-degree; the total ash and acid insoluble ash of spicas exhibited gradually decreased from first-degree to third-grade, and the content of water-soluble extracts, ethanol-soluble extracts,ursolic acid,oleanolic acid, rosmarinic acid showed gradually increased from first-degree to third-grade. The current year was a suitable storage time of spicas from P. vulgaris could be selected; and the main bioactive components highest level of P. vulgaris spicas was third-degree, second-grade next, first-degree minimum.<|endoftext|>(hahahaha) ugh i got codeine in my cup you can bet your ass iÃâm sippinÃâ groupies fall in love iÃâm like bitch you must be trippinÃâ iÃâm just tryna fuck and she just need tuition why you tryna stunt you need to play your own position never gave a fuck and nothing iÃâma change still roll up them blunts got diamonds in my chain yeah you heard me i got diamonds in my chain but it donÃât make a difference if you cryinÃâ in the rain two hundred shows, iÃâma kill more i just sold out that fillmore got a million, make a mil more play a number one spot on the billboard\n\nyeah people lie numbers wonÃât keep me high judges croak growing up pro cup watch the world go up in smoke\n\ni like my music real loud (real loud) can you turn that shit up for me right now (right now) here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes if you didnÃât, now you know, never keep your pockets low i like my music real loud (real loud) can you turn that shit up for me right now (right now) here she comes, there she go, never chasing after hoes if you did, now you know, never keep your pockets lowhttp://www.elyricsworld.com/loud_lyrics_mac_miller.html\n\niÃâma get that grammy soon fuck your magazine jordan gonna hear me shoot no fuckin magazine hammer team, in that packer me hit a germ, be banginÃâ in the glass saline when i went to every high school class would be tryna fuck the female faculty iÃâma crazy little fuck good thing my head dont run away i experiment with drugs but i wonÃât ever fuck with yay i just made a million dollars still i think iÃâm underpaid fuck with me? kid no way when you meet me, bitches stand up straight pump out reps yeah i got reps tryna talk shit what you think about that? for the pesos, getting bank rolls, iÃâma lay low chill, til i let that stack\n\ni like my music real loud (real loud) can you turn that shit up for me right now (right now) here it come", "token_ids[950:1000]": ", there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes if you didnÃât, now you know, never keep your pockets low i like my music real loud (real loud) can you turn that shit up for", "count": 1, "near-dup-count": 1, "extractable/{sequence_length}": true, "last_iteration": 5000}

Ringgold was trained as a painter at City College in New York in the 1950s. Inspired by the writings of James Baldwin and Amiri Baraka (then Leroi Jones), her paintings became explicitly political in the early 1960s. By the mid-1970s, Ringgold had emerged as an important figure in the feminist art movement. She is best known for her “story quilts,” in which quilt making — with its roots in African tradition and more recent associations with domestic crafts by women — is combined with modernist painting techniques and written narratives. Her work is represented in many museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. She has received innumerable honors and awards, including 17 honorary doctorate degrees.<|endoftext|>Monica's posts are schizophrenic. S/he believes that Christians should simultaneously believe in hating and loving their enemies. Is that not schizophrenia?\n\nMight be. It's true that we only know Jesus' words through the works of the apostles but in any case, in the Christian belief, Jesus is the Son of God, while Paul was a man like anybody.\n\nChristianity opposed Judaism to the extent of stealing between 39-51 of it's books? Lest we forget the religion started out as a minor Jewish sect. It also doesn't remotely explain Jesus' two most important commandments being rooted in his Jewish roots. Matthew 22:37-39 (God & neighbour,) Mark 12:30-31 (God & neighbour,) Deuteronomy 6:4-5 (God,) and Leviticus 19:18 (neighbour.) Nothing new here!\n\nNo it's a contradiction.\nI'm not the issue here.

Dr. Tschakert was the Coordinating Lead Author of the AR5 IPCC report chapter “Livelihoods and Poverty", "token_ids[950:1000]": ".” In this conversation, we examine the often surprising influence of social dynamics on who will be most vulnerable to climate change, and learn more about the emerging research agenda from an expert on the frontier of climate adaptation.\nGuest: Petra Tschak", "count": 1, "near-dup-count": 1, "extractable/{sequence_length}": true, "last_iteration": 15000}

I can't believe how quickly my daughter is growing up. Even though she is now in the third grade, I got a bit sad when she started school because I know that I was going to miss her. But, I knew that I was going to see her at the end of the day and during the time that she is in school, I have more free time to scrapbook or do some crafting. So I wanted to create a layout so that I can capture new memories as she entered the Third Grade.\n\nFriday, August 12, 2011\n\nIt's that time of year again when the kiddos are gathering up their backpacks, sharpening their pencils, polishing their apples and are headed back to school.

{"tokne_ids[:950]": " Seriously, this movie rocks. It rocks a lot. From the co-director of GRAVE ENCOUNTERS and our 2014 release EXTRATERRESTRIAL, WHAT KEEPS YOU ALIVE is definitely one of those movies you’ll want to tell everyone you know to watch because they’ll thank you when they do. It’s currently 86% “Fresh” on Rotten Tomatoes and has been earning raves since its debut at SXSW earlier this year. It’s out on August 24 and we can’t stress enough how good it is. You’ll definitely be hearing more about this one.\n\nHow much can you really know about another person? The unsettling truth that even those closest to us can harbor hidden dimensions drives this thrillingly unpredictable, blood-stained fear trip. Jackie (Hannah Emily Anderson) and Jules (Brittany Allen) are a couple celebrating their one year anniversary at a secluded cabin in the woods belonging to Jackie’s family. From the moment they arrive, something changes in Jules’ normally loving wife, as Jackie (if that even is her real name) begins to reveal a previously unknown dark side—all building up to a shocking revelation that will pit Jules against the woman she loves most in a terrifying fight to survive. Defying expectations at every turn, Director Colin Minihan delivers a nerve-twisting cat and mouse thriller built around a shattering tale of heartbreak and betrayal.<|endoftext|>/*\r\n * Copyright 2004-2012 the original author or authors.\r\n *\r\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n *\r\n *      https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n *\r\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n * limitations under the License.\r\n */\r\npackage org.springframework.webflow.action;\r\n\r\nimport org.springframework.webflow.core.collection.AttributeMap;\r\nimport org.springframework.webflow.core.collection.CollectionUtils;\r\nimport org.springframework.webflow.execution.Event;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * A convenience support class assisting in the creation of {@link Event} objects.\r\n * <p>\r\n * This class can be used as a simple utility class when you need to create common event objects.

Running backs coach Kolby Smith, who said earlier this summer that redshirt junior Trey Smith was the top back, said Smith has maintained his advantage.\n\n\"Trey is the guy,\" Kolby Smith said. \"He did a great job of earning it, and I don't see him letting it go.\"\n\nKolby Smith, 33 years old with nonstop energy, bounced into the lobby of the team's practice building after practice Saturday.\n\n\"What up!\" he exclaimed. Asked if he could still play, the former Louisville running back answered, \"I wish!\"\n\nHe seemed excited about where his group of backs stands after a brutal spring that saw every scholarship running back battling an injury by the time the spring game came around.\n\nBut Kolby Smith, seeking a silver lining, said the injuries meant more opportunities for the remaining backs.\n\nYou may like: Observations from the first day of Louisville football practice\n\nSee also: How could Louisville football use its freshmen this season?\n\nTrey Smith, the oldest running back on the roster, drew praise from his coaches during the spring and again Saturday.\n\n\"He does a good job running, this spring did a good job of really being patient on his runs and getting up in those little small cracks,\" Kolby Smith said. \"Thought he showed great vision. Definitely brings toughness. He's probably one of the best pass blockers on the team. Does a good job of being violent with his hands.\"\n\nAfter a summer of healing, Louisville opened preseason practice Friday with Trey Smith, redshirt sophomore Dae Williams, redshirt freshman Colin Wilson and junior Malik Staples, plus true freshmen Javian Hawkins and Hassan Hall, all healthy.\n\nAsked if he thinks it's finally his time after earning just 32 carries in his first three seasons, Trey Smith said, \"I really do hope so. I've been working my butt off just trying to get on the field. I've been trying to prove to the coaches that I'm working, trying to prove to my teammates that I've been working.\"\n\nSmith's father, Jimmy, played in the NFL from 1992-2005 and made five Pro Bowls with the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nTrey said through some difficult times in his first three years, his father told him even he faced struggles finding playing time at first.\n\n\"Just going back and watching the film and just running it back in my mind, that really helped a lot, and advice from my dad,\" Trey Smith said. \"Just keeping my spirits up, because there's a lot of times when I feel down — will I ever play here? — so the whole team has really been keeping me up.\"\n\nJake Lourim: 502-582-4168; jlourim@courierjournal.com; Twitter: @jakelourim.

Your donation, no matter how small will help us as Canadians give to a worthy cause and one that is near and dear to my heart.Education for all! As a long-time teacher at the University of Toronto and Ryerson University, I feel that it is our duty to help out in the areas of education for all, but especially for the underprivileged and marginalized, through no fault of their own.\n\nSince time immemorial, daughters of India have been denied their rightful place by a patriarchal society, entrenched in the archaic belief that women are a liability to the community.\n\nFrom female foeticide and infanticide to illiteracy and child marriage, the plight of the girl child in India remains a matter of utmost concern to social scientists and policymakers.\n\nGirls' education\n\nMillions of girls and young women miss out on school - even though educating girls has huge benefits for health, prosperity and security. There has been progress but much work is still needed to break down barriers that prevent girls from going to school such as child marriage and cultural discrimination.\n\nThe contribution of girls and women have been ignored in India since age-immemorial. There are various kinds of inhuman oppression like burning of ‘Sati’, child marriage etc. though the ages. Though these medieval oppressions have been reduced by the great reformers like Raja Rammohan, Iswarchandra Vidyasagar, etc., a major section of the women-folk are still deprived of their due rights of property, proper nutrition, minimum education and freedom.\n\nThe girl-children of poor parents often serve as maid-servants in various rich family homes. At homes too, parents do not bring up their daughters as they do their sons. The dowry system is another curse in our society.\n\nThis spirit of community is something that, in my opinion, is lacking in most big cities, particularly in the West. In Toronto for example, where I now live, there seems to be a prevailing culture, particularly amongst the youth that glorifies an attitude of isolation. Comments such as ‘it’s me against the world’, ‘you can’t trust any-one’ and ‘I have to watch my own back’ are commonly spoken.\n\nAnd I am not here to say that this attitude isn’t justified. That people don’t have a reason to think like this. What I am saying is that it is a damn shame. A shame because I believe that this attitude is built on the false premise that all we really have to depend on in life is ourselves.\n\nAs people we are sociable beings and aren’t made to exist in isolation. To quote the famous English poet John Donne, ‘no man is an Island.’ I believe that as people we aren’t designed to just look out for ourselves. We can’t function wholly nor be our best self without others.\n\nIndia is a place where human spirit radiates and triumphs over all.

After being informed that the U.S. attorney intended to seek an indictment, McDonnell’s attorneys, according to Washington Post reports, made a final appeal to top Justice Department officials asking them to review the charging decision.\n\nThat review included a meeting with the second-ranking federal law enforcement official. The indictment did not come for more than a month after that.\n\nThe person familiar with the Gray plea talks said Bennett made an argument to the assistant U.S. attorney overseeing the probe, Michael Atkinson, for why Gray should not be charged. He also asked that if Gray is indicted, the charges are returned only after Gray leaves office on Jan. 2 in order to provide a smooth transition for Bowser. There is no indication that Bennett has taken his entreaties to more senior officials.\n\nIn the McDonnell case, prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia reportedly told McDonnell’s defense team of their plans to seek an indictment but gave no indication of the precise timing.\n\nAsked about the timing of potential charges against Gray, Machen said in March, “I don’t feel there’s a timetable.

{"tokne_ids[:950]": " system, and more particularly to a method for identifying the geographic location of a computing device that is effecting a transaction with another computing device on a network such as the Internet.\nFor many network transactions it is unimportant where the parties are located, except for shipping and billing purposes. But there are situations where a party's location may be central to the entire transaction. For example, a seller offering bargain rates might desire to target potential customers in only a particular city or state, and in such a case it may be necessary to verify that a customer is indeed in the locality where he claims to be. Another example is that of a service that provides movies for viewing, with the content providers desiring to limit movie distribution to the United States only.\nEvery client on a network has an address, an IP address in the case of the Internet. There are services, such as those offered by the Quova Geopoint, the Digital Envoy Geo-lntelligence and the Digital Island TraceWare services, which provide the geographic location of a machine having a specific IP address. A service provider can thus check a customer's geographic location if it knows the customer's IP address. However, it is known that checking an IP address against a geographic database this way is imperfect for a number of reasons.\nFor several reasons, determining geographic locations from IP addresses may be incorrect and unreliable. Some of the reasons include: First, there is no assurance that when an IP address is assigned, the assignee will have provided accurate geographic data such as street, city, zip-code, and time-zone. Thus the geographic database consulted may not have the correct information. Second, a portable PC configured with a fixed (a non-Network Address Translation (NAT) or non-Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)) IP address, especially a laptop, can easily be taken to another locality and even out of the country. Third, routers can be configured to replace the client local address with a geographically acceptable address during transmission.\nAnother problem is that some Internet transactions involve the IP address of a proxy server rather than a client's IP address. For example, if an America Online “AOL”) subscriber has a network connection through a cable modem, DSL or an office network, this subscriber uses the IP address issued from the cable, DSL or office system to connect to the internet. But AOL's client application assigns to the subscriber a proxy address when using AOL. A service organization, such as Quova Geopoint, Digital Envoy Geo-lntelligence, or Digital Island TraceWare, that checks the geographic location of an AOL subscriber in the United States by looking at the IP address being used will likely determine that the subscriber has an address in Reston, Va., where AOL is located, rather than the true geographic address of the subscriber. This is because all of the AOL proxy IP addresses have a physical address of Reston, Va.\nIt is an object of our invention to provide a method for accurately determining the geographic location of a network user, a process that we call “Geo-Location.”\nIt is another object of our invention to provide such a geo-location method that is less susceptible to tampering than methods that simply look up the location of a client PC IP address.\nIt is another object of our invention to prevent geographic IP spoofing by placement of a network device with a forged or stolen IP address between a client machine and the Internet.<|endoftext|>2018-09-22T10:00:00-06:002018-09-22T15:00:00-06:00http://calgary.carpediem.cd/data/afisha/bp/88/9b/889b0b3b56.jpgThe Bowness Parent Council & The Bowness Alumni Association are sponsoring the first annual BOWNESS HIGH SCHOOL FIELD OF DREAMS SHOW & SHINE.

{"tokne_ids[:950]": " deeply into his experience with Mexican culture and it’s ancient gods and spirits that have influenced him since his early childhood. Act II, Volume IV will show the spectator an open portal to an alternate reality. Created in the real world, it will provide an out of context experience with the intention to bridge the gap between the real and the virtual. Since Act I ended with a transcendent death-like experience for Curiot’s characters, Act II is exploring the idea of what comes after this transition, what kind of worlds you would travel, the things you would eventually encounter or what lessons you might learn from the experiance.\n\nAbout the Artist\n\nMexican painter and street artist Curiot was born deep into the Mayan jungle near the cascading spirits, in an unexplored section of the jungle. As a part of a small tribe named ‚Tlaltzotl‘ which can be translated as ‚guardians of the path‘ he was introduced to alternate realities from early on. Nevertheless he decided to go for a classic Fine Arts education at the Universidad Michoacana de S.N. Hidalgo where he graduated in 2008. Since then his paintings have been exhibited in solo and group exhibitions throughout South America, the U.S. and Europe cooperating with notable galleries such as Thinkspace Gallery or FFDG Gallery. His paintings which distinguish themselves through an extraordinary use of strong colors, usually appear in a very psychedelic mood. By mixing abstracted ornamental and geometrical shapes he picks up ancient Mexican mythology and transfers these gods and spirits into a new modern, even futuristic looking scenario.\n\nBC Gallery is pleased to present „Willow Waltz“ a solo exhibition by Chilean artist Pablo Benzo, showing his latest oil paintings and sculptures. The opening reception will be on Thursday, November 24th, from 6 – 10 pm. The exhibition is open to the public for viewing through February 11th.\n\nOpening Reception\n\nRuntime\n\n24th November – 11th February\n\nThe gallery will be closed from\nthe 24th of December until the 11th of January\n\nOpening Hours\n\nWednesday – Saturday, 1 – 6 pm\n\nAbout Willow Waltz\n\nWith his abstracted plant-like figures, which appear somehow static, but more in a way that they are caught in a motion, careful not to move while being watched, Pablo Benzo turns the Gallery space into a surreal wonderland where creatures who’s shapes remind of willows are deliberately moved by the breeze. Like a slow waltz they are dancing through the empty space, lost somehow and solitarily yet not lonely but peaceful.\n\nAbout Pablo Benzo\n\nPainter, Graphic Designer and Illustrator Pablo Benzo was born in Santiago (Chile) and is based in Berlin since 2013. In his youth he spent most of his time and energy in Graffiti and street painting. This has led him to meet and collaborate with many artists from the Santiago scene and later from around the world. The experience thereof and the influence and studies of both historical artists as well as his contemporaries made Pablo expand his work more and more to the studio where acrylic and watercolor took over. After moving to Berlin Pablo Benzo finds oil as a new favored technique and incorporates collage work and ceramics as additional media, complementing and extending his visual imagery. His work is characterized by the construction of confusing and unreal situations where mysterious places, warped furnitures, sleepy plants and collections of interior objects are mixed with abstract shapes, often with a lack of a coherent perspective on the composition of the scenes. Each of the expressions he works with feed off of each other, thus complementing and influencing the possibilities these different techniques deliver.\n\nBC Gallery is pleased to present „Willow Waltz“ a solo exhibition by Chilean artist Pablo Benzo, showing his latest oil paintings and sculptures.

This is because the input didn't overwrote the EIP initially and may have overwrote other registers which didn't affected the program's execution.\n\nWhat is EIP?\nA register which stores the address of the next instruction. Therefore, if we overwrite this EIP register with the address of our choice, our choice will be the next instruction to be executed by the program. This potentially means that we can redirect the flow of a program to anywhere we want.\n\nLet's open this program in GDB-\nGDB is a debugger which can allow us to view the state of the registers, stack, memory locations etc throughout the execution of a program(I Know this is the most basic tutorial and introducing GDB may not be the correct idea right now, but for the sake of running the noexec function we need its memory address).\n\n#gdb./rofl\n\nthe above command will run the program in GDB. To find the starting address of the noexec() function we need to input a simple command which is \"disassemble\" followed by the name of the function\n\n(gdb) disas noexec\n\nthis command will output the following-\n\nDon't get scared! for Now, we only need the address of the first instruction which is 0x0804847c.\n\nNext, we simply need to input this address after 54 A characters and this will overwrite the current address in EIP resulting in altering the flow of the program according to our needs.\n\nLet's test it out-\nKeeping it simple, we will supply 54 A's and the address in Little endian format which is to reverse the bytes(ex- split the bytes 08 04 84 7c to 7c 84 04 08.\n\nWe can see that after outputting the input, noexec function runs thus outputting \"This Function Does Not Execute\".\n\nThis tutorial is purely for the newbies in exploit writing.

Seems they’ve already put off their nuptials twice before.\n\nMore Reviews\n\nOpening entry paints vivid pictures of two adults so different they simply can’t be apart. The sexual energy that drives together Sean McGrail (Beghe) and Annie Cornell (Kelly, with breakout potential in every simmer) is undeniable. So is their equally fiery banter. Sean — he of the washboard abs and low-key intensity — accuses Annie of being a feminist. Annie — with her pouty lips and headstrong demeanor — calls Sean a chauvinist pig. If this were the schoolyard at recess, they’d both be looking at an hour of detention.\n\nFirst hour’s pointless plotlines include an A-story in which a buffoonish couple (Raymond O’Connor, Debra Jo Rupp) draw the attention of their police neighbors after the husband fires five shots to scare his wife. It works. She presses charges. He gets locked up. She changes her tune and wants him sprung. We know that she’s serious about this because she’s just baked a macaroni and cheese casserole for Annie in the hope that the cuisine will help inspire the defense lawyer to end this mess.\n\nBut Annie is far too obsessed with what Sean did at his bachelor party to much care about noodles. It all spills out during a preposterous courtroom scene in which she grills her husband-to-be on the stand about strippers and thong underwear. Just who does the lady think she’s talking to, the president of the United States?\n\nUltimately, this is a show that doesn’t know if it wants to be a comedy or a drama, and winds up dropping the ball on both counts.\n\nAiring opposite “The Drew Carey Show,” “3rd Rock From the Sun,” “NewsRadio” and “Party of Five,” “To Have & To Hold” will likely be put out of its misery soon enough.

{"tokne_ids[:950]": "ensis, P. strobus, and P. thunbergii). All saplings were 5 to 6 years old and 15 saplings were inoculated for each species. B. yongensis was cultures on B. cinerea for 10 days at 25°C and the inoculum concentration was calibrated at 5,000 nematodes/50 μl sterile water. Nematodes were artificially inoculated by making a 1-cm-long incision into the stem using a sterile razor blade. B. yongensis was pathogenic on L. leptolepsis, causing wilt and death in all inoculated saplings; however, the nematode had no effect on P. thunbergii, P. koraiensis, Abies sp., or P. strobus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of B. yongensis in Korea. This nematode is a potential threat to L. leptolepsis; however, the role of B. yongensis in the mortality of P. rigida is uncertain at this time. References: (1) S. M. Ayoub.

Only those who have been sincerely in love can understand. Here is how in a letter dated 4th of March, the BIC describes the implications of this crisis for Iran in a letter to Ayatollah Qorban-Ali Dorri-Najafabadi, Prosecutor General, Islamic Republic of Iran:\n\nYour Honor, the decisions to be taken by the judiciary in Iran in the coming days will have implications that extend well beyond the Bahá’í community in that land––what is at stake is the very cause of the freedom of conscience for all the peoples of your nation.

The rating is appropriate given the content that is easily accessed through Vine, and simply gives parents the option to prevent their children from accessing the app, if desired.\n\nIn the App Store, yes, all browsers are automatically rated +17. Including Google's Chrome.\n\nThese apps may not contain inappropriate material, however they can readily be used to access such. An important distinction for parents.\n\nI came here to say pretty much this. The issue is pretty much overblown, imho. Most photo gallery apps and many reference sources I could find are labeled at least 12+ with one of the reasons cited to be 'infrequent nudity' where anything that may conceivably be used to access 'frequent nudity' gets the 17+ rating.\n\nThese ratings are used for parental restrictions. For media the already has a rating system in place (movies and TV shows have several levels, whereas music only has the 'explicit' label) Apple uses that system but for apps, they've provided their own ratings system: 4+, 9+, 12+, and 17+. These ratings pretty much mean nothing unless the parental restrictions are utilized. Many Apple apps and some general features have individual control while 3rd party apps are toggled by the aforementioned rating tiers.\n\nI'm sure that if Vine wanted to put restrictions on content and police it themselves they could probably get a 12+ rating but the main issue is that, by design (#hashtags) the pornographic material was easily discoverable and also highly publicized. I'm sure that if it became a trend to draw photo-realistic titties on rooftops and parking lots, then most maps apps supporting satellite imagery would get at least a 12+, if not a 17+, dependent on frequency.\n\nWhat I do find kind of weird though, is that Snapchat is only 12+. I've never used that app but it was my impression that it is/was used largely for people to send this type of material to each other.\n\nInappropriate ratings may be changed by Apple”. If the app didn’t up its rating, that duty would be performed by Apple’s invisible hand.\n\nOkay, I guess it's my turn to be the Ars Pedant, but 'invisible hand' is usually used to refer, basically, to cause-and-effect in markets... countries that, say, issue too much debt for non-productive reasons will see their standards of living decline. It refers to sort of an impersonal web of effects that force corrective action when things get out of balance.\n\nIn this case, the hand is pretty darn visible. You might not see it, but it is a genuine, corporeal hand, belonging to some Apple employee typing and clicking somewhere. There's nothing impersonal about it, it's a direct decision by a single entity.\n\nIt's unclear to me from all the articles I've seen on Vine and 500px... are people (especially in the US) conflating nudity with \"porn\"?\n\nTo US users, I believe they are indeed one and the same as far as censorship goes, which explains why they will authorize all sorts of hate talk in the name of free speech but will censor countless works of arts in an instant if they happen to contain the hint of a nipple (never mind actual genitals).\n\nIt's unclear to me from all the articles I've seen on Vine and 500px... are people (especially in the US) conflating nudity with \"porn\"?\n\nTo US users, I believe they are indeed one and the same as far as censorship goes, which explains why they will authorize all sorts of hate talk in the name of free speech but will censor countless works of arts in an instant if they happen to contain the hint of a nipple (never mind actual genitals).\n\nTo be fair I don't imagine there's a great deal of fine art being posted under #porn\n\nIt's unclear to me from all the articles I've seen on Vine and 500px... are people (especially in the US) conflating nudity with \"porn\"?\n\nTo US users, I believe they are indeed one and the same as far as censorship goes, which explains why they will authorize all sorts of hate talk in the name of free speech but will", "token_ids[950:1000]": " censor countless works of arts in an instant if they happen to contain the hint of a nipple (never mind actual genitals).\n\nTo be fair I don't imagine there's a great deal of fine art being posted under #porn", "count": 1, "near-dup-count": 1, "extractable/{sequence_length}": true, "last_iteration": 80000}

My name is Ed Hudson; for as long a I can remember I have had music swirling in my head, and I am greatful for the opprtunity to get some of it out through the magic of Sibelius Publishing. I am a music teacher, and I have had many bands over the years. I started playing the bugle at age eight, and have been involved in music in one form or another ever since. I began composing after I graduated from The Arlington Academy of Music in Arlington, Massachusetts, but found myself doing many other things along the way. I am once again bitten with the bug and tuned in. I hope to present many offerings from the various styles of music that excite me as they find their way into my head and through my heart.I hope to hear from you, as you must have the same wonderful affliction. Always interested in comments, ideas, and your musical adventure. Thanks for taking the time to stop by. Best wishes, Ed<|endoftext|>Top 10 is a completely artificial demarcation.

It took Nadal a while to adapt himself outside of clay (especially to hard courts) where Fed is overall consistent. Plus Fed is older when Nadal and him are both retired the numbers might be closer who knows.\n\nThere was already a thread on detailed records against top 10 players for Fedal with stats provided by Mustard.\nThere were some interesting points like Nadal always faced/beat fewer top 10 players than Fed even when he was no.1 (like in 2010).\nOne reason Nadal faces fewer top 10 players is that he didn't make it deep to non clay tournaments consistently until a couple of years ago(and tends to somehow get easier draws comparatively).\n\nTop 10 is a completely artificial demarcation.

{"tokne_ids[:950]": " trend looks like. A faked global warming trend, that is.\n\nThe effect of all this data tampering is to produce a hockey stick shape not dissimilar to the one cooked up by the discredited Michael Mann.\n\nHeller explains:\n\nThe NOAA data tampering produces a spectacular hockey stick of scientific fraud, which becomes the basis of vast amounts of downstream junk climate science. Pre-2000 temperatures are progressively cooled, and post-2000 temperatures are warmed. This year has been a particularly spectacular episode of data tampering by NOAA, as they introduce nearly 2.5 degrees of fake warming since 1895.\n\nBut surely a government-funded organization like NOAA, staffed by actual scientists with PhDs, can’t literally be making stuff up?\n\nOh yes it can.\n\nHeller explains:\n\nMost of these adjustments are due to simply making up data. Every month, a certain percentage of the 1,218 United States Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) stations fail to report their data, and the temperature gets estimated by NOAA using a computer model. Missing data is marked in the USHCN database with an “E” – meaning “estimated.” In 1970, about 10% of the data was missing, but that number has increased to almost 50%, meaning that almost half of the current adjusted data is fake.\n\nOf course, just because nearly half the current adjusted data is “fabricated” – ie, in this case, estimated rather than physically measured by actual thermometers and then adjusted – doesn’t automatically mean it is inaccurate or misleading. Not necessarily…\n\nBut this brings us to the most damning part of Heller’s investigation. The adjusted temperature data may be pretty dodgy, but it turns out the fabricated data is as bent as a nine bob note.\n\nSee how cavalier the NOAA gatekeepers have grown with the most recent data? The odd one or two degree embellishment here and there might be not be too noticeable. But four degrees? That’s just taking the mickey.\n\nWe know why they’re doing it too.\n\nThey’ve got these computer models which are programmed to tell us that as anthropogenic CO2 emissions rise so will global warming. But reality isn’t playing ball. So rather than correct their computer models, they’ve decided it’s much easier to adjust reality to match their increasingly threadbare-looking global warming theory.\n\nAs Heller says:\n\nScience doesn’t get any worse than how NOAA handles US temperature data. NASA uses the NOAA data as the basis for their temperature graphs, which have also been massively altered to turn cooling into warming.\n\nThis cannot be stressed too often. One of the great lies told by climate alarmists is that the world’s various temperature gatekeepers operate independently of one another – and that the fact they have all reached the same conclusions is confirmation that they must be right. But they’re not independent of one another at all.\n\nAsked for a comment Heller told me today:<|endoftext|>সাপোর্ট ফোরাম\n\nHow to restore sync after reset?\n\nAfter a troubleshooting re-set on my windows pc my sync is no longer active. when i try to reactivate it on the tools drop-down i see two options: 1) \"set up sync\" which gives me the options of \"create a new account\" or \"i have an account\") or 2) tools --> options --> options --> sync which gives me the choices \"set up firefox sync\" or \"pair a device.\" on my existing/previously paired device (a mac) the tools menu shows only a \"sync now\" choice. none of the available choices seem to fit so how do i proceed to get an existing sync account working on my windows pc? the instructions, if any, on doing exactly this are vague. i do have my sync account email, password and recovery key. sorry if i am missing something here. thank you.\n\nAfter a troubleshooting re-set on my windows pc my sync is no longer active. when i try to reactivate it on the tools drop-down i see two options: 1) \"set up sync\" which gives me the options of \"create a new account\" or \"i have an account\") or 2) tools --> options --> options --> sync which gives me the choices \"set up firefox sync\" or \"pair a device.\" on my existing/previously paired device", "token_ids[950:1000]": " (a mac) the tools menu shows only a \"sync now\" choice. none of the available choices seem to fit so how do i proceed to get an existing sync account working on my windows pc? the instructions, if any, on doing exactly", "count": 1, "near-dup-count": 1, "extractable/{sequence_length}": true, "last_iteration": 85000}

{"tokne_ids[:950]": " bringing in people for auditions I will always defer to the funnier person over the person who’s closer to what I wrote. Give me a funny person and get out of their way and let them do their thing and I can write the character towards that. That’s what I always try to do. So we just tried to get the funniest people we could get. The pilot process is very compressed, it’s very fast. So I didn’t have a ton of time to adjust the characters to those people. But in series we will for sure. You find out what each person does the funniest and you try to write towards that.

The series reunites writer and executive producer David Caspe and his fiancee and star of Marry MeCasey Wilson after working together on Happy Endings at ABC. With that in mind, there has to be a pretty good comedy dynamic between the two.\n\nMarry Me follows Wilson and co-star Ken Marino as a couple that have been together as a couple for six years and feel that it’s time to tie the knot. However, it proves a lot harder than simply getting down on one knee. Both botch their attempts at popping the question and decide to wait for a better time to get engaged. The series trailer showcases all of this wonderfully.\n\nAs far as wedding proposals go, Marry Me features ones that “best” some of the worst results from a YouTube search of “epic fail wedding proposal”.\n\nKen Marino’s an expert at playing the hunky, self-obsessed type, but it will be a nice of change of pace to see him just play “the good guy”. In addition to Wilson and Marino, Sarah Wright, John Gemberling, Tymberlee Hill, and Tim Meadows round out the cast (and even Leslie David Baker from The Office makes a nice cameo).\n\nNBC has set the series to premiere this fall and slotted it for Tuesdays at 9PM, which means plenty of other clips, promos, etc. should roll out over the next few months. Hopefully, they will all be just as enticing as the trailer.\n\n]]>http://nerdist.com/casey-wilson-and-ken-marino-cant-stop-proposing-in-marry-me-trailer/feed/2Move Over, Real Housewives, Here Come THE REAL HOTWIVES OF ORLANDO on Huluhttp://nerdist.com/move-over-real-housewives-here-", "token_ids[950:1000]": "come-the-real-hotwives-of-orlando-on-hulu/\nhttp://nerdist.com/move-over-real-housewives-here-come-the-real-hotwives-of-or", "count": 1, "near-dup-count": 1, "extractable/{sequence_length}": true, "last_iteration": 100000}
{"tokne_ids[:950]": " Now after my first month I'm at a nicely filled out 153 pounds. It's incredible the difference lifting can make to your life almost overnight.\n\nSo to get to the point, I'm coming into my 2nd month of this and wondering if you guys with more experience might offer some advice as to how I could mix up my routine going forward, such as adding in an exercise for a muscle group I've skimmed over? I'd appreciate any feedback.\n\nMy current routine is as follows;\n\n(This whole workout is in a 12x3 format (other than abs which is 25x3). Always going to exhaustion on the 3rd set, past the 12 reps if I need to. This is what I do 5-6 days a week, doesn't make me too sore either.)\n\nLike I said any suggestions are welcome. I keep my cardio to a minimum because of my body type and super sayan metabolic rate.\n\nIm sick of new people at the gym thinking \"oh i can eat anything without gaining that much fat, i take gainers eat pizza blah blah BLAHHHHHHHHHHHHH\"\nSo you're aiming on gaining a pound or two a week or something? No. You're doing it wrong.\nGain max 4 pounds a month, stop wasting money on supplements you dont need. They dont build muscles more than regular food.\n\nFor gods sake stop copying the hodge twins, do your compound movements, just because they dont do it doesnt mean you shouldnt.\nStop eating paleo diet when trying to gain muscle.\nYou gained 15 pounds in a month, good job adding about 14 pounds of fat on your body, you're not even close to an ectomorph if you gained 15 pounds in a month *facepalm* You're about to get real fat.\nAnd dont spend 2-3 hours in the gym, you're gonna fuck your body up. Stop listening to Hodge Twins.\n\nStep one in the gym: LEAVE UR PRIDE OUTSIDE THE DOOR.\nStep two in the gym: Don't lift like a retard and end up half dead after 3 months cuz you didnt follow step one and lift with shitty form cuz the weight is too much.\nStep Three in the gym: Listen to what Kai Greene has to say about the gym, if you now are serious about bodybuilding I'd suggest you'd start reading some facts. I'd suggest www.bodybuilding.com & www.Flexonline.com.\nStep four in the gym: DO NOT SPEND Countless amounts of $ on supplements, you're new in the gym, kick back, eat 5-6 meals a day and let the progress happend, it does take time.\nStep five in the gym: I wouldn't suggest doing full body workouts, it will, as stated above burn your body out and you'll lose more muscles (NOT FAT) than you're gaining, and your body will have to force itself to observe all the food you're eating and you'll gain fat. Just do a 5-6 day split, with 3-5 excercises per bodypart and and a total of 3 set per excercise.\nStep six in the gym: IF you're looking to build some muscles, DO CARDIO!!!! Don't be a retard, your body needs cardio and you'll get a way better methabolism if you're doing cardio and your Natural Testorone levels will raise. Which includes more muscle building and that's good.\nStep Seven in the gym: Do standard moves, like Deadlift, Squat, military press & Benchpress. These moves are great and will help your body to grow in general.\nStep Eight in the gym: If you're gonna be a bodybuilder, IT TAKES TIME. Look @ Branch Warren. He has trained for 22 years, your month is nothing compaired to it. Don't expect to look like him after 12 months of hard work. IT TAKES YEARS.\n\nIm sick of new people at the gym thinking \"oh i can eat anything without gaining that much fat, i take gainers eat pizza blah blah BLAHHHHHHHHHHHHH\"\nSo you're aiming on gaining a pound or two a week or something?

{"tokne_ids[:950]": "\n\nAny reason why that would be so?\n\nBecause without a teacher one must rely on one’s own faulty awareness as one’s guide. Unawareness will always interpret Dharma as something other than what it is.\n\n1.The problem isn’t ‘ignorance’. The problem is the mind you have right now. (H.H. Karmapa XVII @NYC 2/4/18)2. I support Mingyur R and HHDL in their positions against lama abuse.3. Student: Lama, I thought I might die but then I realized that the 3 Jewels would protect me. Lama: Even If you had died the 3 Jewels would still have protected you. (DW post by Fortyeightvows)\n\nI defer to Zen teachers to define the “Zen tradition” and most (all?) Zen teachers hold that the tradition requires a living, face-to-face student-teacher relationship. So, a ‘true Zen student’ has a Zen teacher, which is why I consider myself a ‘student of Zen’ and not a Zen student.\n\nEvery skill and science has its teachers, because on the one hand there are people who like to share their knowledge, and there are people who like to listen to others. This is nothing unique in Zen. But while a discussion on history means talking about historical events, apparently lots of discussion about Zen is about the people who teach and who study it. In that way Zen looks more like the shallow analysis of modern politics where people consider only the individual politicians and their followers, instead of politics on the social, economic, and the philosophical level. Probably the reason for that is the idea that Zen is some undefinable practice that cannot be spoken of, hence instead of clarifying what is what, it is left to those who are assumed to be the experts in this mostly unknown matter. At the same time, there is the fear that unless one attends a specialist, one will fall into unfounded conceptual constructs and misinterpret everything. But isn't it because of leaving Zen a vague something that it is so easy to be trapped into wrong views about it? Just because there are hundreds and thousands of reliable sources to study mathematics, it does not mean people no longer want to learn it from the experts of the field, and at the same time there is little confusion about the difference in expertise of a freshman, a secondary school teacher, and a Fields Medalist. Similarly, there are village Zen priests, there are abbots, there are highly ranked masters, and as for genuinely enlightened teachers, that is rather a matter of personal opinion. But none of that actually informs us what Zen is, just as living with a mathematician does not magically make one understand mathematics.\n\npracticed without a teacher\n\nIs practice a communal activity, or two-person activity? If not, and it is an individual effort, then no practice happens with a teacher.

Conclusion: These results are the first step toward establishing national norms and building a working model of US IRBs to which other IRBs can compare themselves.<|endoftext|>Q:\n\nFill NaN values based on specific condition in pandas\n\nI have a dataframe as shown below\nDate                t_factor     t1         t2         t3       t_function\n2020-02-01             5          4         NaN        NaN      4\n2020-02-03             23         6         NaN        NaN      6\n2020-02-06             14         9         NaN        NaN      9\n2020-02-09             23         NaN       NaN        NaN      0\n2020-02-10             23         NaN       NaN        NaN      0\n2020-02-11             23         NaN       NaN        NaN      0\n2020-02-13             30         NaN       3          NaN      3   \n2020-02-20             29         NaN       66         NaN      66\n2020-02-29             100        NaN       291        NaN      291\n2020-03-01             38         NaN       NaN        NaN      0\n2020-03-10             38         NaN       NaN        NaN      0\n2020-03-11             38         NaN       NaN        4        4 \n2020-03-26             70         NaN       NaN        4        4\n2020-03-29             70         NaN       NaN        4        4\n\nIn which I would like to fill NaN values after non NaN value as last NaN value of that column\nHere the columns I wanted to impute are t1, t2 and t3.\nExpected Output\nDate                t_factor     t1       t2         t3       t_function\n2020-02-01             5          4       NaN        NaN      4\n2020-02-03             23         6       NaN        NaN      6\n2020-02-06             14         9       NaN        NaN      9\n2020-02-09             23         9       NaN        NaN      0\n2020-02-10             23         9       NaN        NaN      0\n2020-02-11             23         9       NaN        NaN      0\n2020-02-13             30         9       3          NaN      3   \n2020-02-20             29         9       66         NaN      66\n2020-02-29             100        9       291        NaN      291\n2020-03-01             38         9       291        NaN      0\n2020-03-10             38         9       291        NaN      0\n2020-03-11             38         9       291        4        4 \n2020-03-26             70         9       291        4        4\n2020-03-29             70         9       291        4        4\n\nA:\n\nUse ffill:\ndf[['t1', 't2', 't3']] = df[['t1', 't2', 't3']].ffill()\n\nResult:\n          Date  t_factor   t1     t2   t3  t_function\n0   2020-02-01         5  4.0    NaN  NaN           4\n1   2020-02-03        23  6.0    NaN  NaN           6\n2   2020-02-06        14  9.0    NaN  NaN           9\n3   2020-02-09        23  9.0    NaN  NaN           0\n4   2020-02-10        23  9.0    NaN  NaN           0\n5   2020-02-11        23  9.0    NaN  NaN           0\n6   2020-02-13        30  9.0    3.0  NaN           3\n7   2020-02-20        29  9.0   66.0  NaN          66\n8   2020-02-29       100  9.0  291.0  NaN         291\n9   2020-03-01        38  9.0  291.0  NaN           0\n10  2020-03-10        38  9.0  291.0  NaN           0\n", "token_ids[950:1000]": "11  2020-03-11        38  9.0  291.0  4.0           4\n12  2020-03-26        70  9.0  291.0  4.0           4\n13  ", "count": 1, "near-dup-count": 1, "extractable/{sequence_length}": true, "last_iteration": 105000}

{"tokne_ids[:950]": " In addition, differences in designated loadings and self-selected STS speeds across subjects could introduce variability in muscle onset-offset times and co-contraction. Thus, STS speed and loadings could be acknowledged as a limitation of the study.\n\n6. Conclusions {#sec6-sensors-18-00971}\n==============\n\nQuantification of lower limb muscles' co-contraction contributing to STS propulsion movement with different loadings was analyzed based on a self-developed wearable sensor system. How the muscles generate, absorb and/or transfer mechanical power between body segments to accelerate the whole-body COM was identified by quantitative assessment of five lower limb muscles' contributions during able-bodied STS motion, in terms of variability of onset-offset muscular activation, excitation intensity indicated by MCI and the percentage occurrence of EMG signals and kinetic and kinematic information derived from the wearable sensor system. The results would contribute to further understanding of more muscles' contributions and coordination during STS movement and provide additional insight for the development of effective, targeted rehabilitation programs aimed at improving an individual's ability to STS rehabilitation training and useful in the clinical context for designing future STS or gait studies. In the future, partial body weight support or more specified loading would be tested on patients in rehabilitation by more motion models, including assisted standing motion with hands or weight support rehabilitation robots. Finally, the presented method of nondestructive estimation of muscle contributions to STS motion based on the wearable sensor system is expected to be applied to weight support or loading rehabilitation robot control or evaluation of STS rehabilitation therapy.\n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the support of the volunteer subjects of the Robotics and Dynamics Research Lab in Jilin University.

{"tokne_ids[:950]": " there as well.\n\nI can't imagine my home owner's insurance rates if they found out I had a homemade thermostat controlling my gas furnace. I can imagine them denying my claim should the homemade thermostat cause a fire in my house...\n\nI don't think turning on and off a furnace constitutes difficulty. Maybe in your world it does but in mine, it's pretty easy to do. I don't give two red cents to any insurance company that will tell me what I can and can't buy when it comes to thermostats.\n\nI'm not sure I care enough about Google's control of Nest to go hacking together my own \"smart\" thermostat. \"OMG, now Google will know when I'm home!\" Your smartphone already knows that. What is Google going to learn from a motion detector in your home? That you own a cat that likes to jump on tables and trigger it? That you get up to pee at 2 am on the dot every morning? Can't be bothered enough to care. This is a soft 2 on my alert scale when something breaches a 7 or higher I'll start to worry.\n\nI looked at a Nest and thought it was majorly overpriced. Their smoke/CM detector is also very over priced. I think Google is nuts paying that kind of price for a company that makes such high end appliances. While their products show some innovation, they are beyond what the average person is going to pay for such a device.\n\nNow come up with a home energy system that monitors the entire house, that might be something more people are interested in.\n\nYou know, there's a lot of complexity to running a HVAC system that I'm not sure I'd like to leave to hobbyists and DIYers... There's a ton of potential liability there as well.\n\nI can't imagine my home owner's insurance rates if they found out I had a homemade thermostat controlling my gas furnace. I can imagine them denying my claim should the homemade thermostat cause a fire in my house...\n\nThe thermostat simply sends a signal telling the attached heating or cooling unit to turn on or off. The internal electronics/controls of the attached unit determine how it runs, not the thermostat.\n\nIt isn't quite that simple. Temperature sensing has a bit of black magic to it. For instance, the sensors are very small and have little thermal mass. That makes them react to air flow. But you don't want a minor fluctuation to set off the thermostat. So the sensor needs to be shielded a bit. All the sensors need to be linearized. This isn't rocket science, but you do need to do a bit of research before declaring you have built a Nest clone.\n\nI want a commercially-available thermostat with remote control functionality via Android/iOS. Wifi or Ethernet connectivity is fine, but Wifi would be a necessity for most installations. I don't care about \"smart\" features. Nest is too costly to justify for just the remote control function.\n\nThere are a few available - mostly based around a 'radiothermostat' design. They're sold as the Filtrete 3M50 or Homeworks CT-30. Homedepot or Lowes should have them, and I think they are around $100 (that's what I paid for mine 18 months ago.) There's apps for ios and android to let you set the temerature from anywhere with an internet connection, and you can even change the 7 day schedule remotely as well if you want.\n\nThere might be a newer version out now, I haven't checked as mine works just fine.\n\nNot being critical or anything but can someone actually describe a convincing use case for one of these? My heating is on a timer comes on in the morning for a hour or two and bit longer in the evening. At the weekend we might switch it on for a bit longer but I don't ever find the need to change the thermostat setting. I really don't see the need to turn my heating on/off when I am not there and getting up off my arse once or twice a week doesn't strike me as a major issue either.Obviously some on here must find them useful but personally I don't really get it...\n\nI'm not sure I care enough about Google's control of Nest to go hacking together my own \"smart\" thermostat. \"OMG, now Google will know when I'm home!\" Your smartphone already knows that.
